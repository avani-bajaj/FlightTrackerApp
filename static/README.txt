Place a background GIF named "flight_bg.gif" in this folder to enable the subtle animated background.

Notes:
- Keep the file size reasonable (e.g., <3–5 MB) to avoid slow loads.
- A calm animation (window-seat view, clouds, or line-art plane) works best.
- The UI applies low opacity (≈0.15) and gentle gradients to reduce distraction.
